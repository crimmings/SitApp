#SitApp

SitApp is my independent project submission for Prime Digital Academy.

Like most families, mine is always busy. With three small children, my wife and I
juggle difficult schedules, and we often need babysitters on short notice. Even when
we know ahead of time that we'll need a babysitter, we usually wait until the last minute,
which often backfires. SitApp was designed to be a simple, one-stop babysitting request application
utilizing the network of babysitters we already use. I plan to continue to develop this application,
with the hopes of improving its usability and making it possible for multiple families to use.

I spent two weeks working on this project, incorporating a full-stack of software development tools.
This included JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Jade. I also used the Twilio API
