        p#sit SIT is my independent project submission for Prime Digital Academy.

            | Like most families, mine is always busy.  With three small children, my wife and I juggle difficult schedules,
            | and we often need babysitters on short notice.  Even when we know ahead of time that we'll need a babysitter,
            | we usually wait until the last minute, which often backfires on us. SIT was designed to be a simple,
            | one-stop babysitting request application utilizing the network of babysitters we already use. I plan
            | to continue to develop this application, with the hopes of improving its usability and making it possible
            | for multiple families to use.

            | I spent two weeks working on this project, incorporationg a full-stack of software development tools.
            | This included Javascript, jQuery, Node.Js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Jade. I also used the Twilio API to
            | serve the project's SMS capabilities.
